Codsoft Tasks:
In this project, I independently developed three responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

1) Online Meal Ordering Website - A landing page designed for an online meal ordering service, showcasing a clean and user-friendly interface
2) Portfolio Website - A professional portfolio website to highlight my skills and projects.
3) Calculator Application - A functional and interactive calculator built with core frontend technologies.

All these projects are fully responsive and focused on frontend development principles.
